## Test Scenarios, Prompts, and Responses

### Scenario 1: Creative Story Generation

**Prompt Type** 

**Naïve Prompt**: “Write a story.”

Response:

Once upon a time, a young girl named Maya wandered through a forest and discovered a small wooden box buried under a tree. Inside was a golden key that shimmered in the sunlight. She searched for the lock it belonged to and finally found an old door hidden behind vines. When she turned the key, the door opened to a beautiful garden filled with glowing flowers. From that day on, Maya visited the secret garden whenever she felt lonely, finding peace among its colors and light.

**Basic Prompt** : “Write a 150-word imaginative story about a young inventor who builds a robot to help lonely people. Include an emotional tone and end with a hopeful message.” 

Response:

In a quiet town, a young inventor named Leo spent his nights surrounded by gears, wires, and dreams. He often watched people sit alone in cafés and parks, their eyes filled with silent longing. One day, he decided to create Ami — a small robot designed to talk, listen, and share warmth. Ami could remember birthdays, tell stories, and even hum lullabies. When Leo released Ami into the world, something beautiful happened — laughter returned to empty homes, and conversations filled the quiet corners of hospitals and care centers. Though Leo built Ami to heal others, he soon realized it healed him too. As he stood watching his creations spread joy across the city, Leo smiled. “Even the smallest spark of kindness,” he whispered, “can light up the darkest hearts.” Hope, he learned, was the most human invention of all.

### Scenario 2: Factual Question Answering

**Prompt Type** 

**Naïve Prompt**: “Who is Einstein?”

Response : 

Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is best known for his equation E = mc², which shows the relationship between energy and mass. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which helped establish quantum theory. He made major contributions to science and is widely regarded as one of the greatest minds in history.

**Basic Prompt** : “Explain who Albert Einstein was, highlighting his major scientific contributions, famous theories, and one interesting fact about his life.” 

Response :

Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist whose work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy. His Theory of Relativity—especially the equation E = mc²—revealed that mass and energy are interchangeable, forming the foundation of modern physics. Einstein also made groundbreaking contributions to quantum mechanics through his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Beyond science, Einstein was known for his humanitarian views and advocacy for peace, often speaking out against war and social injustice. An interesting fact about his life is that he had a deep love for music, particularly the violin, which he played to relax and think. He once said, “Life without playing music is inconceivable to me.” Einstein’s genius and compassion made him not only a brilliant scientist but also a symbol of curiosity and hope for humanity.

### Scenario 3: Summarization

**Prompt Type** 

**Naïve Prompt**:  “Summarize climate change.”

Response : 

Climate change refers to the long-term shift in Earth’s climate patterns, mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions increase greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures. As a result, the planet experiences extreme weather, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and threats to ecosystems. In simple terms, climate change means the Earth is getting warmer and facing serious environmental challenges that affect all living things.

**Basic Prompt** : “Summarize the concept of climate change in 150 words. Include its causes, impacts, and solutions. Keep it clear for a high school audience.”

Response :

Climate change is the long-term alteration of Earth’s temperature and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities. The biggest cause is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The impacts of climate change are already visible — melting polar ice, rising sea levels, stronger storms, droughts, and threats to wildlife and agriculture. It also affects human health and increases the risk of natural disasters. To fight climate change, we need to reduce carbon emissions, switch to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, plant more trees, and use energy efficiently. Everyone — from governments to individuals — can make a difference. By acting now, we can protect our planet and ensure a safer, cleaner future for generations to come.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and recognizing images or sounds. Examples of AI include virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems used by Netflix or Amazon. AI works by using large amounts of data and algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions or predictions. In simple terms, AI helps computers “think” and “act” like humans to make life easier and more efficient.

**Basic Prompt** : “Explain Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simple terms suitable for beginners. Include examples of where it’s used and how it impacts everyday life.”

Response :

Artificial Intelligence (AI) means teaching computers to think and learn like humans. Instead of just following fixed instructions, AI systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. For example, virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant use AI to understand your voice and answer questions. Netflix and YouTube use AI to suggest shows or videos based on what you like. Self-driving cars use AI to detect objects and navigate roads safely. In everyday life, AI helps in healthcare to detect diseases, in finance to prevent fraud, and in smart homes to control lights or fans automatically. AI is becoming a part of nearly everything we do — making tasks faster, smarter, and more convenient. However, it also reminds us to use technology responsibly and ethically as it continues to grow.
