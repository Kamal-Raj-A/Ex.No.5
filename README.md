# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: ChatGPT

# Explanation: 

Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:

Select various scenarios such as:

● Generating a creative story.

● Answering a factual question.

● Summarizing an article or concept.

● Providing advice or recommendations.

● Or Any other test scenario

For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:

Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.

Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?

Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.

## Types of Prompts:

1. Naïve Prompt

A short, unclear, or vague prompt that provides minimal instructions or context.
Example: “Tell me a story.”

2. Basic Prompt

A clear, detailed, and structured prompt that specifies:

● Context or background information

● Expected format or tone

● Explicit instructions or constraints

Example:
“Write a creative short story (150–200 words) about a young inventor who builds a robot friend. Use an emotional tone and end with a positive message.”

# OUTPUT

## Test Scenarios, Prompts, and Responses

### Scenario 1: Creative Story Generation
| **Prompt Type** | **Prompt** | **ChatGPT Response (Summary)** |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Naïve Prompt** | “Write a story.” | ChatGPT wrote a short 5-line story about a girl finding a treasure, but it lacked depth and emotional tone. |
| **Basic Prompt** | “Write a 150-word imaginative story about a young inventor who builds a robot to help lonely people. Include an emotional tone and end with a hopeful message.” | ChatGPT generated a full, emotional story about an inventor named Leo who built a robot ‘Ami’ to comfort the elderly. The story had structure, emotion, and a moral ending. |

### Scenario 2: Factual Question Answering
| **Prompt Type** | **Prompt** | **ChatGPT Response (Summary)** |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Naïve Prompt** | “Who is Einstein?” | ChatGPT gave a short bio: “Einstein was a physicist who developed the theory of relativity.” |
| **Basic Prompt** | “Explain who Albert Einstein was, highlighting his major scientific contributions, famous theories, and one interesting fact about his life.” | ChatGPT provided a structured paragraph covering relativity, Nobel Prize, quantum photoelectric effect, and an interesting anecdote about his violin hobby. |

### Scenario 3: Summarization
| **Prompt Type** | **Prompt** | **ChatGPT Response (Summary)** |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Naïve Prompt** | “Summarize climate change.” | ChatGPT gave a broad 3-line summary mentioning global warming and pollution. |
| **Basic Prompt** | “Summarize the concept of climate change in 150 words. Include its causes, impacts, and solutions. Keep it clear for a high school audience.” | ChatGPT produced a concise, well-structured summary mentioning greenhouse gases, melting ice caps, rising temperatures, and renewable energy as solutions. |

---

### Scenario 4: Advice / Recommendation
| **Prompt Type** | **Prompt** | **ChatGPT Response (Summary)** |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Naïve Prompt** | “Give me career advice.” | ChatGPT gave generic advice: “Work hard, set goals, and keep learning.” |
| **Basic Prompt** | “I’m a computer science student interested in machine learning. Suggest five career paths, essential skills to learn, and one free resource for each.” | ChatGPT listed roles like Data Scientist, ML Engineer, and Researcher. Each included key skills (Python, TensorFlow, Statistics) and resources (Coursera, Kaggle, Fast.ai). |

---

### Scenario 5: Explaining a Concept
| **Prompt Type** | **Prompt** | **ChatGPT Response (Summary)** |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Naïve Prompt** | “Explain AI.” | ChatGPT gave one paragraph defining AI as “machines that simulate human intelligence.” |
| **Basic Prompt** | “Explain Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simple terms suitable for beginners. Include examples of where it’s used and how it impacts everyday life.” | ChatGPT explained AI clearly with real-world examples like voice assistants, recommendation systems, and healthcare applications, making it easy for beginners to grasp. |
